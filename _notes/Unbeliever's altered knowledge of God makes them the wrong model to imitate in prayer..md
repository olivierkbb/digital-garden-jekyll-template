Title: Unbeliever's altered knowledge of God makes them the wrong model to imitate in prayer.
---

The second of the two groups Jesus commanded us not to imitate or follow the examples concerning prayer is the unbelievers.

Gentiles are not a model for us to emulate in prayer.
>[[Matt-06#v7|Matt-06,7-8]] "And when you pray, do not heap up empty phrases *as the Gentiles do*, for they think that they will be heard for their many words.  *Do not be like them*, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him.  [[Matt-06#v7|]][[Matt-06#v8|]]

It reminds me Elijah's prayer vs Baal priests's prayer in [[1 Kings-18]] :20-40

Elijah did not pray anyhow. He choose a special time (offering's time), a special place (God's alter), specific purpose (God's glory : So that Israel will know that you are God and you send me)

He did not choose the Baal priest's as model to pray. Even though,
- They were in great number than him.
- They had more influence and power in the kingdom than him.
- They performed before notable wonders known from. But Elijah did not.
