Title: Religious are not models to emulate in prayers
---
[[Matthew MOC]] %% tags: #on/prayer %%
One of two groups Jesus command us not to imitate or follow the examples concerning prayer is the religious.

>[[Matt-06#v5|Matt-06.5]] "And when you pray, *you must not be like the hypocrites*. For they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and at the street corners, that they may be seen by others. Truly, I say to you, they have received their reward.

They pray to be seen by others. They want to show up, draw attention to them. They are actors. Jesus called them Hypocrites.

They use their time to make a public show of themselves and receive the glory from the people around them.

Our time of prayer is not a time for a public show and external demonstration to  bring the glory to us.
